# CreatiQuick
A rapid creatinine level detection device

****Why CreatiQuick****

According to data, 1 in 10 people worldwide are affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and there is 1 death for every 57 people with the condition.
From 1990 to 2017 death rate increased by 141.5%.

The creatinine level in human serum or urine plays a major role in detecting the condition of our kidneys. That's why it's necessary to have regular checkups to monitor creatinine levels.

CreatiQuick is a pocket-sized device that displays a person's creatinine level using a color code, indicating whether it is within a safe range or above the normal level.




****Working Principle****

CreatiQuick is based on 2 mechanisms
    
--Paper based microfluidics for sample tensfer towards reaction zone 

--Colorimetric detection to display the result

For paper based microfluidics, we have used nitrocellulose membrane. This works with the principle of diffusion. It carries the sample to the reaction site.

Colourimetric detection: Here the creatinine present in urine or serum reacts with picric acid and makes yellow-orange compound which represents the concentration level of creatinine.

The intensity of the colour is proportional to the creatinine concentration.
