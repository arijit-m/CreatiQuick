# CreatiQuick – Rapid Creatinine Detection Device

## Overview

**CreatiQuick** is a compact, paper-based diagnostic device designed for the **rapid, colorimetric detection of creatinine levels** in biological fluids such as urine or serum. This low-cost, point-of-care solution is intended for early screening of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**, offering a simple visual readout to indicate whether the user's creatinine level is within a healthy range.

According to recent global health statistics, **1 in 10 people suffer from CKD**, and the mortality rate has increased by **141.5% between 1990 and 2017**. Regular monitoring of creatinine is critical for early intervention and better prognosis.

## Working Principle

CreatiQuick operates using two primary mechanisms:

1. **Paper-Based Microfluidics**  
   - A **nitrocellulose membrane** is used to passively transport the sample (via capillary action) to the reaction zone.  
   - This membrane works on the principle of **diffusion and fluid wicking**, enabling a power-free system.

2. **Colorimetric Detection**  
   - The creatinine in the sample reacts with **50 mM Picric Acid** and **0.1 M NaOH** (2:1 ratio), forming a **chromogen**.  
   - The resulting **yellow-orange color** intensity correlates with creatinine concentration.  
   - The chromogen absorbs light at **490 nm**, making quantification possible via image analysis or a visual reference strip.

## Results Visualization

- Safe range: Lighter yellow tones  
- Unsafe range: Darker orange tones  
- The test can be interpreted using a simple color chart or spectrophotometric analysis.
